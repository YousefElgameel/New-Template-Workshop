# Runbooks

Reusable incident-response playbooks, captured from postmortems by the `runbook-writer`
skill and consulted live by the `incident-responder` agent.

- One file per failure mode, kebab-case slug (accessed by name during an incident, not number).
- Each has: what it looks like (symptom + signal + a Log Analytics KQL query), triage,
  mitigate, verify-recovery, root-cause patterns.
- No credentials, PII, or "ping <person>" steps — a runbook must work without a specific human.
