# HTTP API reference

The complete HTTP surface of both services as they exist today: **no business endpoints have
shipped yet** — this documents the operational foundation (`/ping`, `/info`, `/health`) plus the
two demo BFF routes in `apps/web` that exercise the `web → api` hop. Derived from the route
source, cross-checked against the test suites (`routes.test.ts`, `test_routes.py`).

`apps/api` (FastAPI) is the **only backend**; it took the `api` name in
[ADR-0005](../adr/0005-name-services-by-role.md). The former **NestJS** `apps/api` service — a
different service (origin `0a71`, retired) — and with it `/ping/chain`, `/info/chain`, and the
BFF routes `/api/ping-python`, `/api/info-python`, `/api/ping-chain`, `/api/info-chain` — was
removed in [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-remove-nestjs-api-layer.md).

## Route map

| Method | Path                | Service          | Purpose                                                         | Versioned?       |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| GET    | `/ping`             | `apps/api`       | Liveness greeting                                               | No (operational) |
| GET    | `/info`             | `apps/api`       | Status/version/runtime report                                   | No (operational) |
| GET    | `/health`           | `apps/api`       | Health + observability state                                    | No (operational) |
| GET    | `/v1/*`             | `apps/api`       | Mandatory business router — **empty**, no routes registered yet | Yes (`/v1`)      |
| GET    | `/api/ping-backend` | `apps/web` (BFF) | Proxies `apps/api` `/ping`                                      | No (demo route)  |
| GET    | `/api/info-backend` | `apps/web` (BFF) | Proxies `apps/api` `/info`                                      | No (demo route)  |
| GET    | `/health`           | `apps/web` (BFF) | Own health + observability state (no upstream call)             | No (operational) |

Business endpoints, when they arrive, are `/v1/<feature>` on the api (routers attached to
`v1_router`) and `/api/v1/<feature>` on web (folder-enforced). See [Versioning](#versioning).

## `apps/api` — FastAPI (port 8000, origin `0c70`)

Source: `apps/api/app/routes.py` (operational router, mounted at root by `app/main.py`).
`app/routers/v1.py` defines `v1_router` (`prefix="/v1"`) but **no feature router is attached
yet** — `/v1/*` currently 404s.

### `GET /ping`

```json
{
  "service": "api",
  "message": "hello from the AI Accelerator api service",
  "trace_id": "0c70…"
}
```

- `service` — fixed string `"api"`.
- `message` — fixed greeting string.
- `trace_id` — the request-scoped trace id (adopted from a valid inbound `x-trace-id`, or
  generated with origin `0c70`). When called through the BFF it is the **web-minted** `0eb0…`
  id, because the api validates only the 32-hex **format**, not the origin prefix
  (`apps/api/app/tracing.py`).

No upstream call — the api is the end of the hop.

### `GET /info`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "api",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "env": "local",
  "uptime_seconds": 12.345,
  "runtime": { "name": "python", "version": "3.14.0" },
  "system": {
    "platform": "Linux",
    "arch": "x86_64",
    "pid": 1,
    "hostname": "api-abc123"
  },
  "observability": "disabled",
  "reason": "no Azure connection string",
  "trace_id": "0c70…"
}
```

Field notes (`apps/api/app/routes.py`):

- `version` — `importlib.metadata.version("ai-accelerator-api")` (the dist name from
  `pyproject.toml`); falls back to `"unknown"` if the package metadata isn't installed.
- `env` — `APP_ENV` lowercased, default `"local"`.
- `uptime_seconds` — `time.monotonic() - _STARTED` (captured at module import), rounded to 3
  decimals.
- `runtime` — `{ "name": "python", "version": platform.python_version() }` — the **interpreter** name, not the service (which is `"api"`); unchanged by the rename (ADR-0005).
- `system` — `{ platform: platform.system(), arch: platform.machine(), pid: os.getpid(), hostname: socket.gethostname() }`
  (`platform.system()` returns `"Linux"`/`"Windows"`/`"Darwin"`, capitalized).
- `observability` / `reason` — see the reason-string table in
  [Observability state reasons](#observability-state-reasons) below.

### `GET /health`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "api",
  "trace_id": "0c70…",
  "observability": "disabled",
  "reason": "no Azure connection string"
}
```

`status` is unconditionally `"ok"` — this endpoint reports process liveness + observability
state, not database health. **The database is never queried here**: the SQLAlchemy engine is
lazy and the baseline issues no queries, so `/health` is green with the placeholder
`DATABASE_URL`.

---

## `apps/web` — Next.js BFF demo routes (port 3000, origin `0eb0`)

Source: `apps/web/src/app/api/{ping,info}-backend/route.ts`. Every handler is wrapped in
`withBff` (`src/lib/trace.ts`), which resolves/adopts `x-trace-id`, runs the handler inside the
trace-id async-local scope, and **unconditionally echoes `x-trace-id`** on whatever `Response`
the handler returns (success or error). Upstream calls use `fetchUpstream` (never bare `fetch`).

| Route                   | Upstream call             | Base URL env var (default)               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/ping-backend` | `GET {API_BASE_URL}/ping` | `API_BASE_URL` (`http://localhost:8000`) |
| `GET /api/info-backend` | `GET {API_BASE_URL}/info` | `API_BASE_URL` (`http://localhost:8000`) |

In `docker-compose.yml` the base URL is overridden to `http://api:8000` (compose DNS).

### Success response shape

On success, each route returns the **upstream JSON body verbatim** (`Response.json(data, {
status: res.status })`) — the BFF does not add its own envelope. So:

- `/api/ping-backend` → the api's `/ping` shape (see above).
- `/api/info-backend` → the api's `/info` shape.
- The upstream's own `trace_id` field matches the response's `x-trace-id` header, because the
  BFF forwards its resolved trace id to the api, which adopts it (valid 32-hex format,
  origin-agnostic). This single hop is the `x-trace-id` propagation the contract exists to
  demonstrate: one `0eb0…` id on the browser response, on the api's body, and on every log line
  and span in between.
- HTTP status is **mirrored from upstream** — e.g. an upstream 404/500 with a valid JSON body is
  passed through with that same status, not converted to a BFF error.

### `GET /health` (web's own, no upstream call)

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "web",
  "trace_id": "0eb0…",
  "observability": "disabled",
  "reason": "no Azure connection string"
}
```

Unlike the two demo routes, this one never calls upstream — it reports `apps/web`'s own process
liveness + observability state (`apps/web/src/app/health/route.ts`).

---

## api error contract (`apps/api`, `app/errors.py`)

Every non-2xx response from the api — operational routes and `/v1` alike — has exactly this body,
and the same trace id in the `x-trace-id` header:

```json
{ "error": "not_found", "trace_id": "0c70…" }
```

| Situation                                      | Status  | `error`                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unknown route                                  | 404     | `not_found`                                                                               |
| wrong method                                   | 405     | `method_not_allowed` (+ `Allow` header)                                                   |
| request body/query fails validation            | 422     | `validation_error` — fields logged, not echoed                                            |
| `raise NotFound()` / `Conflict("<code>")`      | 404/409 | the class code or the one given                                                           |
| `raise HTTPException(403, detail="read_only")` | 403     | `read_only` (a snake_case `detail` is the code; prose maps to the default for the status) |
| model/search not configured or unavailable     | 503     | `ai_unavailable`                                                                          |
| anything else                                  | 500     | `internal_error` — kind + location logged only                                            |

Codes are stable identifiers the BFF and UI can switch on; messages, validation values and stack
traces never leave the api (rule 50). Streaming routes emit `event: error` with a bounded
`error_kind` once the stream has started (rule 70).

## Error behavior (BFF)

Each of the two demo routes wraps its upstream `fetch` **and** its `res.json()` parse in a single
`try/catch`. Only failures in that block — a network error (e.g. `ECONNREFUSED`, timeout) or a
non-JSON/unparseable upstream body — produce the BFF's own synthesized error response:

```json
{
  "error": "upstream_unreachable",
  "target": "api",
  "trace_id": "0eb0…"
}
```

- HTTP status: **`502`**.
- `target` — always `"api"` today (the bounded target label; `resolveTarget()` maps any
  other host to `"other"`).
- `trace_id` — the BFF's resolved trace id (same value echoed in the `x-trace-id` header).
- The literal error code `"upstream_unreachable"` is used even when the actual cause is a JSON
  parse failure rather than a connectivity failure — the catch block doesn't distinguish the two
  (`apps/web/src/app/api/*/route.ts`).
- An upstream **non-2xx status with a valid JSON body** (e.g. upstream 500) is **not** converted
  to a 502 — it's mirrored through as described above. The 502 path is reserved for cases where no
  upstream `Response` was successfully obtained/parsed at all.

## Headers

| Header                     | Direction                 | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-trace-id`               | Inbound                   | Adopted if it matches `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` (any origin prefix accepted); otherwise a fresh id is generated with the receiving service's origin (`web=0eb0`, `api=0c70`).             |
| `x-trace-id`               | Outbound (every response) | Always echoed — success, upstream passthrough, and the BFF's 502 all carry it. Set unconditionally by `withBff` (web) and `TraceMiddleware` (api) regardless of handler outcome. |
| `x-trace-id`               | Outbound (upstream calls) | Forwarded unchanged on every proxied call — `fetchUpstream` (web); `traced_client()` (api, unused in the baseline — the api has no downstream calls today).                      |
| `accept: application/json` | Outbound (web only)       | Set by `fetchUpstream` on every upstream call (`apps/web/src/lib/trace.ts`).                                                                                                     |

## Observability state reasons

The exact `reason` string on `/health` and `/info` depends on the service and its state — useful
when comparing responses across services (full detail:
[`environment-variables.md`](environment-variables.md#per-variable-notes)):

| State                          | `apps/web` reason                                                                            | `apps/api` reason                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| No connection string (default) | `no Azure connection string`                                                                 | `no Azure connection string`            |
| Enabled successfully           | `ok`                                                                                         | `azure monitor configured`              |
| Invalid `TELEMETRY_AUTH_MODE`  | `invalid TELEMETRY_AUTH_MODE "<value>" — expected "connection_string" or "managed_identity"` | same wording                            |
| Init/config threw              | `<raw error message>` (or `unknown initialization error`)                                    | `configure_azure_monitor failed: <exc>` |

In all cases `observability` is `"enabled"`/`"disabled"` (never any other value), and a
disabled/degraded state never crashes the service — see `.claude/rules/60-observability.md`.

## Versioning

- **Every business HTTP endpoint MUST be URI-versioned (`/v{n}`, starting at `v1`)** — decided in
  [`../adr/0001-api-versioning.md`](../adr/0001-api-versioning.md) and enforced per
  [`../../.claude/rules/05-api-versioning.md`](../../.claude/rules/05-api-versioning.md).
- **The only exemption**: the operational endpoints `/ping`, `/info`, `/health` (both services)
  stay unversioned — container/Azure health probes target fixed paths.
- **This reference documents the foundation surface only** — there are no business endpoints
  yet. `apps/api`'s `v1_router` is mounted but empty; `apps/web` has no `src/app/api/v1/`
  folder yet — the first business BFF route creates it.
