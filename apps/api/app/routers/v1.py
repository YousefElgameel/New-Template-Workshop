"""The ``/v1`` versioned API surface (MANDATORY — ADR-0001 / rule 05).

Every business endpoint MUST be served under ``/v1``. Add a feature router and
attach it here so it inherits the prefix::

    # app/routers/projects.py
    from fastapi import APIRouter
    router = APIRouter(prefix="/projects", tags=["projects"])

    @router.get("")
    async def list_projects() -> list[dict]:
        ...

    # app/routers/v1.py
    from app.routers import projects
    v1_router.include_router(projects.router)   # -> GET /v1/projects

Operational endpoints (``/ping``, ``/health``, ``/info``) are the only exemption
and stay unversioned in ``app/routes.py``.
